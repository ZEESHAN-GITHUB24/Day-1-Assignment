# Day 1 Assignment

Question 1:

What is the time, space complexity of following code:
int a = 0, b = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
a = a + 1;
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
b = b + j;
}

Solution:
Time Complexity: O(N + M),
Space Complexity: O(1)

Question 2

What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?

Answer:
b)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs
